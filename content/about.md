## Hi there hello

I am dragsbruh, I'm a student who does stuff related to computers and the internet. I barely have free time.

Heres a progress bar that tells when I'm finally gonna be a free.

{{< rawhtml >}}
<progress id="timebar" value="100" max="100" style="width: 100%;"></progress>
<sup><i>total: <strong>2 years</strong></i> (<span id="timebar-value"></span>)</sup>

<script>
    function doPercentageTime(start, end) {
        const now = Date.now();
        const totalDuration = end - start;
        const elapsed = now - start;
        return Math.floor((elapsed / totalDuration) * 100);
    };
    let percentage = doPercentageTime(1717558200000, 1780673400000);
    document.getElementById("timebar").value = percentage;
    document.getElementById("timebar-value").innerText = `${percentage}% complete`;
</script>

## Interests

I have a ton of interests so heres a few of them

- Rocket League
- Peer to peer networking
- Onion Router (tor)
- Malware Development
- Backend Development
- More Backend Development
- Automation (partially)

## What I'm working on

At the time of writing this, I am working (or planning on working) on a few things:

- Decentralized social network
- Tor-based fully private chat app (maybe merged with the decentralized social network, or one of them might be removed in favor of the other)
- A small terminal based music player
- A chunked cloud based file storage system
- A reverse proxy service
- A file server

> Ah, college, good old friend. I paused some of these projects because of college.

## Tech Stack

See what tools and infra I use [here](/tools/)

## Plans for future

I kinda dislike working at big companies because, at least now, most of them (not all) seem pretty bad. I think Iâ€™ll focus on my own projects and work at a few startups until I start my own or something.

I haven't really decided on a field yet, but if I had to, then I would pick backend or red teaming.

## Bye~
